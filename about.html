            <h1>Support LGBTQ+ friendly businesses online</h1>
            <p>As you browse the web, <strong>With Pride</strong> highlights a business's commitment to LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion with an icon in the browser toolbar. You can tap the icon for a popup with the business's score along with a link to learn more.</p>

            <h2 id="how">How are businesses scored?</h2>
            <p>With Pride utilizes the Human Rights Campaign's <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/corporate-equality-index" target="_blank">"Corporate Equality Index"</a> for business scores. The index is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies and practices pertinent to LGBTQ+ employees, and is an annual measure of how equitable large private businesses in the United States treat their LGBTQ+ employees, consumers, and investors.</p>
            <p>With Pride takes these businesses and matches them to sites, resulting in over 1,300 scored sites, including a majority of the top-visited sites in the US. But there's still lots to do, and we're hard at work continuing to match sites to businesses.</p>
            <h2 id="who">Who's included?</h2>
            <p>The Human Rights Campaign's <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/corporate-equality-index" target="_blank">"Corporate Equality Index"</a> focuses on corporate policies and practices and therefore includes only large, US businesses. Fortune magazine's 1,000 largest publicly-traded businesses are all invited to participate, and any for-profit, non-government employer with 500 or more full-time US employees can request to participate.</p>
